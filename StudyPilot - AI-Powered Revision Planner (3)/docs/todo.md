# Todo
- #1: Update remaining backend endpoints to use getUserId(c) instead of user.id (~20 endpoints: study plan, analytics, exam results, exam schedule, privacy, chatbot)
- #2: Add "Continue as Guest" button to Login.tsx that generates guest_id and stores in localStorage
- #3: Update frontend API calls to include guest_id parameter for guest users
